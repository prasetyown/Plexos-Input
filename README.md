In this project, i've made coding to simplified the load profile of any power plant so it can be used as PLEXOS input. Plexos can be used as generation expansion planning software

The data input template, could be seen in Profil Wind excel files. And then the output could be seen in wind_profile_csv folder, which will be used as the input of PLEXOS

profile_avgcf.py is used to make load profile by using capacity factor, meanwhile profile_penetration.py is used when we want to consider the renewable energy penetration

Here are the example of the input template. As long as the template doesn't change, you don't need to change the code as well
